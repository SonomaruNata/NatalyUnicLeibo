    <h1><b>Just be yourself!</b></h1>
    <p> The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his 
        room.  The door opens inward.  The knight stands in the doorway, 
        places a hand on the barmaid's hip.  She pauses a moment, then 
        breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall.  He laughs a 
        bit, resignedly, and closes the door.

        A VAMPIRE stands behind it.  Not two feet from the knight, 
        grinning at him.  His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in his 
        head, his bloody smile full with teeth.  His skin is gray, and 
        peeling.  The knight turns slowly and sees him.
