<h2> Example of horror scene:</h2><br>
<q> 
    Abstract images begin to form. They move beneath the
    titles, brilliant against the darkness, the ghost-like
    apparitions fighting a current as if caught in the
    whirlwind of time.
    Our IMAGE SHARPENS. The apparitions are no longer there.
    Instead, police tape comes INTO FOCUS, the seemingly
    miles of it entangled on stacks of derelict cars that
    fill the void. The tape dances before us, undulating to
    a macabre rhythm, floating on the nocturnal winds. We
    PAN.
    An auto wrecking yard at midnight. Empty, yet occupied.
    Light slowly INVADES the FRAME, filling in the wrecking
    yard's cavernous shadows. A distant ROAR announces
    itself above the SOUNDTRACK, the earth POUNDING CLAMOR
    AMPLIFYING in with every second.
    As if searching for its source, CAMERA PIVOTS AROUND.
    Instantly, we find ourselves caught in the glare of
    headlights, and we've just enough time to make out the
    semi truck before it plows through the yard's chain link
    gate, shattering it like so much glass, the truck heading
    directly AT CAMERA, running it over as if it weren't.</q><br>
