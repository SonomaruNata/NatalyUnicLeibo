    <p><i> writhe on the strobe-lit dance floor. A heavy S&M scene. Leather.
        Latex. Tattoos. Body-piercings.<br>

        A D.J. wearing head-mounted spotlights orchestrates the tunes on
        twin- decks. MUSIC assaults us -- a beat so heavy it could jar the
        fillings from your teeth. Brutal "DARKCORE" along the lines of
        Prodigy or Underground. <br>
   
        Raquel pulls Dennis out onto the dance floor. They sway. <br>
   
        A lupine-featured GAULTIER GIRL with a streak of white running
        through her raven hair moves in behind Dennis, pressing up against
        him. Rachel Williams as the Angel of Death -- we'll call her MERCURY.<br>
   
        Mercury flicks her tongue against Dennis' ear -- it's been pierced
        with a silver post which clicks against her teeth. Tattooed across
        her back in black is a swirling, tribal vortex. <br>
   
        Dennis is now sandwiched between Raquel and Mercury, the three of
        them dry-humping their way to every man's glory. <br>
   
        The beat gets LOUDER. The action heavier. The atmosphere more
        narcotic. People are stripping off their clothes, sweating like
        fiends. It's a virtual orgy.<br>
   
        Dennis laughs, reveling in the hedonism. Everything rises to a fever</i></p>
